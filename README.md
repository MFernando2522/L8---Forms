 Lesson 8 Forms, Upload To Github Assessment

Describe your experience using GitHub (good or bad) and describe how it might be useful to you (either personally or professionally).

My experience using GitHub so far is going smoothly, with a bit of windy seas. Id say it would take some time to get used to, as I familiarize myself with the basics. In conclusion I would say GitHub is mainly going good for me. It could help professioally with making multiple people focus on one coding project,as I do like the idea of everyone needing to verify code before updating. I could also get behind this website as well, since it saves code so my computer doesnt overload with files of javascript and html.
